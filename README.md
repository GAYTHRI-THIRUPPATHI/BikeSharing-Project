## PROJECT NAME

### BIKE SHARING DEMANDS

__Aim__ : To build a __multiple linear regression model__ for the prediction of __demand__ for shared bikes.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

A __bike-sharing system__ is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a __short term basis__ for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a __"dock"__ which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.<br><br>
A US bike-sharing provider __BoomBikes__ has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a __mindful business plan__ to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. <br><br>
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to __understand the demand for shared bikes__ among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.<br><br>
For this purpose, the company wants to understand the __factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes__ in the American market and they should know:
> - __Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?__<br>
> - __How well those variables describe the bike demands?__<br>

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. <br><br>
We should model the __demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables__. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to __meet the demand__ levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. <br>

## Conclusions

### Significant features to predict the DEMAND for shared bikes are :  <br>
1. Season (Spring, Winter)
2. Weather (Light Snow or Rain, Misty)
3. Mid Month
4. Weekday (Saturday)
5. Month (January, September, November, December)
6. Year
7. Workingday
8. Temperature
